# Next Door, Skip Two

This is an old solitaire game my father taught me.  He has won it twice in 50+ years of playing.
I won once a few years after playing, and never again in the last 20 years.

This code attempts a few different things:
- provide some basic card and deck functionality
- provide a simulator framework to play the game
- (eventually) provide an AI framework to solve the game
